    <h2>London</h2>
    <hr></hr>
    <p><b>London </b> (/ˈlʌndən/ (listen)) is the capital and largest city of England and the <a href="unitedKingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> , with a population of just under 9 million.[1][note 1] It stands on the River Thames in south-east <a href="england.html">England</a> at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries.[note 2][10] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th century,[11] the name "London" also refers to the metropolis around this core, historically split among the counties of <a href="middlesex.html">Middlesex</a> Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London,[13] which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.[note 3][14]</p>
